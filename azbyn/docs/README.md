# SOLID Principles

- S: Single Responsibility Principle
 Every module, every class, and every function should only have one thing to do.

- O: Open-closed principle
 Entities should be opened for extension and closed for modification.
 In other words, don't change something that already works, extend it.
 
- L: Liskov substitution principle
 Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtype.
 
- I: Interface segregation principle
 Many simple interfaces are better than one complex interface.
 
- D: Dependency inversion principle
 Work with the abstractisation not the implementation.
